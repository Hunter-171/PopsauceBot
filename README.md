## Usage
edit launcher.py
edit the line: client = PopsauceClient("Mr.nobody", "PBKZ")
replace Mr.nobody with the name you want and PBKZ with the room code
save then run launcher.py

you can type messages in cmd, and when you want the bot to start guessing, you type: play
when the game ends and you want the bot to reparticipate in the same game, type: join
! after you type, play , so that the bot to starts guessing you can't type messages only after it finishes the game
